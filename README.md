# wlcterm (Wayland Compositing Terminal)
An ambitious project to make a nested "terminal" with layouts that could host wayland applications and switch between them without using a mouse

## The goal
Lets say you are an emacs fanboy and you want to use GUI emacs and terminal at the same time, you may just use terminal inside emacs but it frankly sucks compared to kitty or most terminals, so the best thing would be if they shared a window! This is basically all wlcterm should do allow nesting applications inside a single window seamlessly
